description: | # anything you'd like here to describe the method.

  Let's keep things simple - this is essentially a canonical
  "Koza"-style variant of GP, with a couple of simple extensions:
  
    1. We scale the input features using Z-score standardisation

    2. We use stochastic gradient descent to optimise model parameters    

    3. We include a single-point mutation operator in addition to
       crossover and subtree mutation (but I am 99.9% sure it doesn't add
       anything)

  Basically, this codebase thinks it's still 1999 and nothing really
  noteworthy has taken place in GP research in 23 years! :)

  The code is in plain (and ugly!) C, with OpenMP bolted on at the
  last minute to take advantage of multiple threads. It should compile
  anywhere without too much difficulty (I think!). The version
  included here is trimmed back a little bit relative to the project
  on GitHub - the version on GitHub uses different file format for
  reading training and testing data, that's not needed here. However,
  the "GP" stuff is essentially unchanged.

  There's no ambitions for victory with this entry - we're aiming for
  a nice simple baseline of performance to contextualise other
  methods. For a long time, work performing symbolic regression via GP
  has compared results against a range of "state of the art" methods,
  and there doesn't seem to be a good reference for what we should
  expect as "minimal" performance for GP. The method used here doesn't
  try to preserve or exploit useful model structure and modularity, or
  introduce domain bias. It doesn't use elaborate feature selection,
  coevolution, multiple objectives, regularisation (save for a limit
  on tree size), or population structure. Aside from a very simple
  gradient descent optimiser, it doesn't try to integrate hybrid
  machine learning approaches, ensemble methods, or anything. It's
  pretty simple, really!
